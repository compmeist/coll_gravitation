# My collateral gravitation hypothesis

I, Nathan Frick, hypothesized in 2011 that, if we are embracing the idea of a quantum-scale entropy decrease as a cause of the gravitation mechanism, then not only will masses attract, but there will be interstitial points between masses that will additionally act to attract other masses.  

## Example

Two planets are experiencing a gravitational attraction,  an asteroid nearby will be attracted to not only the center of mass of each planet, but the asteroid will also be attracted to (some of) the actual space between the planets.

## The N-body simulation

The C Program I have posted is the starting point of a simulation effort.

### Explanation and Comment

I am not formally allegiant to Emergent Gravity ideas (nor of the Einstein Field equations), but arrived at this hypothesis somewhat independently.
